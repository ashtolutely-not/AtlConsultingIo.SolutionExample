## **Repository Overview: Demonstrating Problem Solving, Clean Code, and C#/.NET Core Proficiency**

>This repository showcases my problem-solving abilities, code cleanliness, and depth of knowledge in C# and the .NET Core framework. While not a final product, it serves to highlight key aspects of my skills.

### **Integration Operations Design Notes**
- ***Code Maintenance and Abstraction***: Prioritizing code maintainability for junior developers led me to minimize abstraction layers, resulting in a concise codebase.
- ***Discriminated Union Types***: Employed discriminated union type definitions using the 'OneOf' package to simplify execution paths, seen in options patterns, storage client factories, and generic operation result definitions.
- ***Loose SQL Integration***: The SQL integration is intentionally flexible to facilitate migration across diverse codebases. A future refactoring could transition to Entity Framework for enhanced coherence.
- ***User-Friendly Logging***: Introduced a JSON-based storage logging feature to aid SMBs with limited IT resources in issue analysis. Non-technical users can access logs via a user-friendly UI.

**Implementation Highlights**
- ***Dynamic Configuration***: Leveraged the IOptionsMonitor interface to enable dynamic modification of values without application restarts.
- ***Centralized HTTP Handling***: Configured named HttpClients for REST API operations, funneling requests through a single handler.
- ***Flexible Authentication***: Per-request authentication configured through registered options at startup.
- ***Telemetry and Alerts***: Supports optional metric and event telemetry for Application Insights, aiding alert configuration.
- ***Content Handling***: Manages content negotiation, type coercion, and customizability using Func delegates.
- ***Optimized Azure Client Instances***: Utilizes a factory pattern for Azure client instances to support multiple storage accounts, in line with best practices.
- ***Retry Functionality***: Integrates the Polly library for resilient retry functionality.

### **DevOps Project**
- ***Streamlined Development Process***: Manages build, packaging, and source control tasks across iterations, aided by Roslyn API-based source generation tools.

### **Client-Based Implementation Overview**
The code within demonstrates consumption of the IIntegrations interface within a client-specific project. 

**Problem**:  Addressing complex, brittle presentation layer logic stemming from reliance on 3rd-party resources for Ecomm surfaces.

**Approach:**
- ***Domain-Based Models***: Shifting to models rooted in business domains, reducing dependency on system-specific data architecture.
- ***Decoupling Layers***: Separating presentation from backend models to simplify content transformation.
- ***Optimized CheckoutService***: Replacing a problematic checkout API with a more efficient implementation, utilizing queue triggers for swift processing.
- ***Granular Operations***: Crafting each operation as an independent unit for microservice construction, promoting code reuse and clarity.

These components work in tandem to create a modular, maintainable, and efficient solution that addresses the unique challenges presented.
